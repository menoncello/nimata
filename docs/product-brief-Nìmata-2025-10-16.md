# Product Brief: Nìmata

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Author:** Eduardo
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**Nìmata** is a BunJS-powered CLI tool that makes high-quality code automatic, not aspirational, through a three-pillar quality cascade: **Start Right** (scaffolding), **Find Right** (validation), and **Fix Right** (intelligent refactoring).

**The Problem:**
AI-assisted developers waste 10-30 minutes daily re-explaining project context to AI assistants, projects without upfront quality configuration accumulate exponential technical debt, and simple code fixes consume expensive AI prompts when static tools could handle them in milliseconds.

**Our Solution:**
Nìmata orchestrates the complete quality workflow from project inception through ongoing maintenance. It scaffolds TypeScript+Bun projects with comprehensive quality tooling pre-configured, generates persistent AI rules files (CLAUDE.md, BMAD configs) to eliminate context re-establishment overhead, validates code through unified orchestration of proven tools (ESLint, TypeScript, Bun Test, Prettier), and intelligently routes simple fixes to static refactoring while generating AI prompts for complex improvements.

**Target Market:**
Primary: AI-assisted TypeScript/JavaScript developers (mid-senior level, 3+ years experience) who value quality but struggle with tooling setup complexity and AI context management. Secondary: Engineering team leads seeking to standardize quality across 3-15 developer teams.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Only tool** combining quality-first scaffolding + AI integration + intelligent refactoring triage
- **Orchestration over invention:** Leverages battle-tested tools rather than building proprietary alternatives
- **AI-native by design:** First-class support for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf with persistent context
- **Intelligent cost optimization:** Static-first approach saves time and AI API costs
- **Quality cascade effect:** Each pillar amplifies the others (better setup → fewer issues → easier fixes)

**Business Model:**
Open-source core with premium tiers. MVP launches free, post-MVP introduces Pro tier ($9-15/month) for advanced features and Enterprise tier ($99-299/month/team) for team collaboration, custom templates, and compliance features.

**Success Metrics (6 months):**
500+ active users, 60% retention rate, NPS 40+, 100+ GitHub stars, clear product-market fit validation.

**Investment & Returns:**
MVP investment: $0-60K (solo founder) or $60-150K (small team). Conservative 18-month projection: $38K ARR. Optimistic: $204K ARR. Strategic value beyond revenue: developer tool credibility, potential acquisition target for Vercel/GitHub/Anthropic.

**Next Steps:**
This Product Brief serves as strategic foundation for creating detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Phase 2: Planning.

## Problem Statement

Developers face three critical quality-related pain points that compound throughout the software development lifecycle:

**1. Context Alignment Problem (AI Friction)**

- Developers waste 10-30 minutes per session re-explaining project structure, architecture decisions, and coding standards to AI assistants
- AI tools hallucinate and generate incorrect code without clear constraints and project-specific rules
- No standardized way to provide persistent, structured context that both AI and humans can reference
- **Impact:** Reduced productivity, inconsistent code quality, wasted AI API costs on correcting hallucinations

**2. Quality Snowball Effect (Configuration Void)**

- Projects that don't configure quality tools (linting, testing, formatting, type checking) from day one accumulate technical debt exponentially
- Developers face decision paralysis choosing from dozens of tooling options without guidance
- Retrofitting quality tools into existing projects is 5-10x more expensive than starting with them
- **Impact:** Lower code quality, increased bug rates, higher maintenance costs, slower feature velocity

**3. Inefficient Fix Workflow (Tool Mismatch)**

- Simple syntax/formatting errors require full AI prompts, which are expensive (API costs) and slow (network latency)
- Static refactoring tools can fix simple issues in milliseconds, but developers default to asking AI for everything
- No intelligent triage system to route simple fixes to static tools and complex refactoring to AI
- **Impact:** Wasted time and money on trivial fixes, delayed feedback loops, reduced developer flow state

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- **Project scaffolding tools** (Yeoman, Plop, create-react-app) focus on initial setup but don't address ongoing quality validation or AI integration
- **Linting/formatting tools** (ESLint, Prettier) work in isolation without orchestration or intelligent workflow integration
- **AI coding assistants** (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf) lack persistent project context and quality guardrails
- **No existing tool** combines all three pillars: quality-first scaffolding, validation orchestration, and intelligent refactoring triage

**Why Solve This Now:**

- AI-assisted development is becoming standard practice (60%+ of developers use AI tools in 2025)
- Quality debt accumulates faster in AI-assisted workflows without proper guardrails
- Static analysis tools are mature and reliable, but underutilized in modern workflows
- Developer productivity gains from AI are limited by context re-establishment overhead

---

## Proposed Solution

**Nìmata** is a BunJS-powered CLI tool that makes high-quality code the path of least resistance through a three-pillar quality cascade system:

**The Quality Cascade:**

1. **Start Right** - Quality-first interactive project scaffolding
2. **Find Right** - Orchestrated validation with enhanced reporting
3. **Fix Right** - Intelligent refactoring triage (static for simple, AI-assisted for complex)

**Core Approach:**

**Pillar 1: Start Right (Scaffolding with Quality DNA)**

- Interactive CLI guides developers through project setup with context-aware questions
- Configures comprehensive quality toolchain from day one (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Bun Test)
- Generates AI rules files (CLAUDE.md, BMAD configs) providing persistent project context to AI assistants
- Offers preset bundles for rapid setup while maintaining developer choice
- Initial focus: TypeScript + Bun stack, designed for systematic expansion

**Pillar 2: Find Right (Validation Orchestration)**

- Unified interface orchestrating existing proven tools (don't reinvent the wheel)
- Dual-layer reporting: CLI summary for quick feedback + detailed HTML reports (Stryker-inspired)
- Configurable quality levels (light/medium/strict) with opinionated strict default
- Runs comprehensive validation across linting, type checking, testing, and formatting in one command

**Pillar 3: Fix Right (Intelligent Triage)**

- Static refactoring for simple patterns (readonly variables, const declarations) - instant, safe, automated
- AI prompt generation for complex refactoring (method extraction, architectural changes) - leverages existing AI tools
- Interactive preview before applying changes (builds trust through transparency)
- Smart routing: if static can fix it in milliseconds, don't invoke expensive AI

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Orchestration over Invention** - Leverages battle-tested tools (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Vitest) rather than building new linters
2. **AI-Native Integration** - First-class support for AI coding assistants through persistent context and quality guardrails
3. **Intelligent Cost Optimization** - Static-first approach saves time and money by reserving AI for tasks that truly need it
4. **Quality Cascade Effect** - Each pillar amplifies the others: better setup → fewer issues → easier fixes
5. **Opinionated with Escape Hatches** - Strong defaults guide developers to best practices, flexibility available when needed

**Why This Will Succeed:**

- Solves the complete quality workflow, not just one piece
- Built on proven tools and patterns, not experimental approaches
- Designed for the AI-assisted development era from the ground up
- Focuses on developer experience: fast, transparent, trustworthy
- Extensible architecture (SOLID principles) enables community contributions and parallel feature development

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

**These 6 features form the minimum viable quality cascade - each is essential and must work excellently:**

#### 1. Limited Tech Stack Support (TypeScript + Bun for CLI Projects)

**Why Essential:** Foundation for everything else. Must be rock-solid and extensible before expanding.

- Interactive CLI setup wizard with context-aware question filtering
- Complete project scaffolding with opinionated directory structure
- Dependency management (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- SOLID architecture enabling future stack additions without core rewrites
- **Success Criteria:** User can scaffold working TypeScript+Bun CLI project in <5 minutes

#### 2. AI Rules Engine

**Why Essential:** Immediate differentiator preventing AI hallucinations from day one.

- Pre-cached common rules library (TypeScript best practices, no `any`, testing patterns)
- Generate CLAUDE.md and BMAD agent configuration files during scaffolding
- Multi-format export (adapters for different AI tools)
- Project-specific rule customization
- **Success Criteria:** AI assistants follow project rules 80%+ of the time without re-prompting

#### 3. Integrate Existing Quality Tools (Orchestration Layer)

**Why Essential:** Core "Find Right" pillar - validates quality cascade actually works.

- ESLint integration with enhanced reporting
- TypeScript compiler integration (type checking)
- Bun Test integration (built-in testing framework)
- Prettier integration (code formatting)
- Unified CLI interface: single `nìmata validate` command runs all tools
- **Success Criteria:** Developers can validate entire project quality in single command, <30 seconds

#### 4. Configurable Quality Levels (Light/Medium/Strict)

**Why Essential:** Flexibility without sacrificing opinionated defaults. Enables broader adoption.

- Three preset quality configurations (strict default, medium/light opt-down)
- Clear documentation of differences between levels
- Easy switching between levels post-scaffolding
- **Success Criteria:** 80%+ of users choose "strict" (validates defaults work), but flexibility exists

#### 5. Simple Static Refactorings

**Why Essential:** "Fix Right" pillar foundation - proves intelligent triage concept works.

- 5-10 simple refactoring patterns (readonly variables, const declarations, arrow function conversions)
- AST-based pattern detection and safe transformation
- Interactive preview with diff before applying changes
- Scope selection (single file, directory, or entire project)
- **Success Criteria:** Users fix 70%+ of simple issues via static refactoring instead of AI prompts

#### 6. AI Prompt Generation for Complex Refactoring

**Why Essential:** Completes "Fix Right" pillar while staying safe (human reviews AI suggestions).

- Identify complex refactoring scenarios (method extraction, complexity reduction)
- Generate formatted prompts with code context for Claude Code/Windsurf
- Template library for common complex refactoring types
- One-click copy to clipboard for paste into AI tool
- **Success Criteria:** Users successfully use generated prompts for 60%+ of complex refactorings

### Out of Scope for MVP

**Features deferred to post-MVP to maintain focus and ship faster:**

**Stack Expansion:**

- ❌ React, Vue, Angular, Svelte frontend frameworks
- ❌ Express, Fastify, NestJS backend frameworks
- ❌ PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis database setups
- ❌ Monorepo scaffolding
- **Rationale:** Start with ONE stack excellently. Extensible architecture allows parallel development of stacks post-MVP.

**Advanced Refactoring:**

- ❌ IDE-style complex refactorings (extract method, rename intelligently)
- ❌ Scope-based batch operations across multiple files
- ❌ Automated structural refactoring (reduce complexity, reorganize)
- **Rationale:** Simple static refactorings prove concept. Complex features require mature foundation.

**AI-Heavy Features:**

- ❌ ML-powered bug prediction
- ❌ Automatic test generation
- ❌ Deep code review and smell detection
- ❌ Pattern recognition and suggestion engine
- **Rationale:** Expensive (time + cost) to build, uncertain ROI. Focus on high-value, proven concepts first.

**Developer Environment Features:**

- ❌ IDE settings/extensions configuration
- ❌ Docker container setup
- ❌ Database schema scaffolding
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline generation
- **Rationale:** Scope creep. Stay focused on code quality cascade, not full environment orchestration.

**Team/Enterprise Features:**

- ❌ Team collaboration and shared templates
- ❌ Custom organizational rule libraries
- ❌ Usage analytics and reporting dashboards
- ❌ SSO, compliance, audit logging
- **Rationale:** Solve for individual developers first. Enterprise features come after PMF validation.

**Integration Features:**

- ❌ Claude Code Hooks deep integration
- ❌ Git hooks automatic installation
- ❌ IDE plugins/extensions
- ❌ CI/CD platform native integrations
- **Rationale:** CLI-first approach works standalone. Integrations add complexity and maintenance burden.

### MVP Success Criteria

- ✅ Documentation rated "clear and helpful" by 80%+ of users
- ✅ Users report 50%+ reduction in AI context re-establishment time
- ✅ 70%+ of users say they "would definitely use for next project"

**Community Validation:**

- ✅ 100+ GitHub stars within first 3 months
- ✅ Positive mentions in at least 3 developer communities/forums
- ✅ 10+ community bug reports or feature requests (evidence of real usage)
- ✅ 5+ external contributors submit PRs

**Go/No-Go Decision Point (Month 6):**
If MVP hits 3 out of 4 validation categories above → **GO**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Ecosystem Expansion)
If MVP misses 2+ categories → **PIVOT**: Reassess core value proposition and user needs

- **Version Control:** GitHub (open source repository)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (native GitHub integration)
- **Package Distribution:** npm registry (ubiquitous JS package manager)
- **Documentation:** VitePress or Docusaurus (modern static site generators)
- **Analytics:** PostHog or Plausible (privacy-friendly, open source options)

### Architecture Considerations

**Core Architecture: Plugin-Based Monolith**

```
nìmata/
├── core/              # Core orchestration engine (plugin loader, CLI)
├── plugins/
│   ├── scaffolding/  # Stack-specific scaffolding plugins
│   ├── validation/   # Quality tool integration plugins
│   ├── refactoring/  # Refactoring pattern plugins
│   └── reporting/    # Report generation plugins
├── templates/        # Stack templates (extensible)
└── rules/            # AI rules library (pre-cached)
```

**Design Principles:**

1. **SOLID Principles (Especially Open/Closed)**
   - Open for extension (new stacks via plugins)
   - Closed for modification (core engine stable)
   - Dependency injection for testability

2. **Convention over Configuration**
   - Opinionated defaults work out-of-box
   - Configuration available for power users
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity

3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
   - Scaffolding must always produce working project
   - Validation errors don't block workflow
   - Refactoring changes can always be reverted

4. **Composability**
   - Each pillar (scaffold/validate/refactor) works independently
   - Combined, they amplify each other
   - Users can use just one pillar if desired

**Key Technical Decisions:**

1. **Monolith vs Microservices: Monolith**
   - Simpler deployment and distribution (single npm package)
   - Easier to maintain and version
   - Can extract to microservices later if needed

2. **Plugin Discovery: Static (Bundled)**
   - MVP ships with all plugins bundled
   - Avoids complexity of dynamic plugin loading
   - Phase 2 can add marketplace/external plugins

3. **Configuration Storage: File-Based**
   - Local `.nimatarc` files in projects
   - No database or server required
   - Easy to version control alongside code

4. **AI Integration: File-Based (No API Calls)**
   - Generate static AI rules files (CLAUDE.md, etc.)
   - No runtime API calls to AI services
   - Keeps tool fast, offline-capable, and cost-free

5. **Update Mechanism: npm**
   - Standard npm update workflow
   - Semantic versioning for breaking changes
   - Auto-update check on CLI invocation (optional)

**Scalability Considerations:**

- **Template Library:** Design for 100+ templates without performance degradation
- **Validation Speed:** Parallelize quality tool execution where possible
- **Refactoring Scope:** Optimize AST operations for projects up to 100K LOC
- **Report Generation:** Lazy-load data for large projects (pagination, virtual scrolling)

**Security Considerations:**

- **Dependency Management:** Regular security audits, Dependabot integration
- **Code Execution:** Sandboxed execution of user-provided scripts (if ever needed)
- **Template Safety:** Validate community templates before featuring
- **API Keys:** Never ship API keys or secrets in scaffolded projects

## Appendices

### A. Research Summary

**Sources:**

1. **Brainstorming Session Results (2025-10-16)**
   - 39 concepts generated across three techniques (First Principles, SCAMPER, What If)
   - Identified core value proposition: Quality Cascade (Start Right → Find Right → Fix Right)
   - Prioritized 6 essential MVP features
   - Key insights: Orchestration over invention, static-first approach, AI-native integration

**Key Findings from Brainstorming:**

- **Fundamental Truth:** Developers waste 10-30 minutes per session re-explaining context to AI assistants
- **Core Insight:** Static refactoring is orders of magnitude faster than AI prompts for simple fixes
- **Strategic Direction:** Start with one stack (TypeScript+Bun) done excellently, expand systematically
- **Differentiation:** First tool to combine quality-first scaffolding + AI integration + intelligent refactoring triage

**Competitive Landscape (Preliminary):**

- **Yeoman:** General-purpose scaffolding, declining usage, no AI integration
- **Plop:** Micro-generator, lightweight, no quality orchestration
- **create-react-app, create-next-app:** Framework-specific, basic setup only
- **GitHub Copilot, Claude Code:** AI assistants without persistent project context or quality guardrails

**Market Opportunity:**

- Growing AI-assisted development adoption (60%+ developers by 2026 projected)
- No existing tool addresses complete quality workflow (setup → validate → fix)
- Developer productivity tools market growing 15-20% annually

### B. Stakeholder Input

**Eduardo (Founder/Creator):**

- Vision: Make high-quality code the path of least resistance through systematic prevention, detection, and correction
- Priority: Focus on TypeScript+Bun initially, design for extensibility
- Philosophy: Opinionated defaults with escape hatches - guide developers without forcing choices
- Concern: Must avoid "yet another tool" fatigue - differentiate through integration and AI-native approach

**Target User Persona (Synthesized):**

- Mid-senior developers using AI assistants, frustrated by context re-establishment overhead
- Value quality but struggle with decision paralysis on tooling setup
- Want faster feedback loops and less time on trivial fixes
- Willing to adopt opinionated tooling if it demonstrably saves time

**Community Needs (Anticipated):**

- Template variety for different stacks and use cases
- Documentation and examples showing clear value
- Transparent roadmap and contribution opportunities
- Respect for existing workflows (don't force wholesale changes)

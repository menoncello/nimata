gate_decision:
  status: "PASS"
  date: "2025-10-16"
  decision_authority: "Murat (Master Test Architect)"

  rationale:
    summary: "Story 1.1 establishes a solid CLI framework foundation with comprehensive test coverage (100% of implemented functionality), excellent performance (50-85% under budget), zero-defect reliability (150/150 tests passing), strong security posture (injection tests ready for Epic 2), and maintainable architecture (SOLID principles, 3.6:1 test-to-code ratio). All 6 acceptance criteria are fully validated with Given-When-Then narratives. Acknowledged usability gaps (color-coded output, actionable error messages) are deferred to Epic 1 Story 1.3+ and Epic 2 by design."

    pass_criteria_met:
      - "All 6 acceptance criteria have FULL coverage with explicit test validation"
      - "100% test pass rate (150 active tests passing, 0 failures)"
      - "Performance exceeds all NFR targets by 50-85%"
      - "Zero critical (P0) or high-priority (P1) gaps identified"
      - "Security tests implemented and ready for Epic 2 activation"
      - "Maintainability architecture supports Epic 2-3 expansion"
      - "Code quality gates passing (0 ESLint violations, TypeScript clean)"
      - "No blocking issues or unresolved critical risks"

    residual_risks:
      - risk: "Usability (NFR003) has acknowledged gaps"
        severity: "MEDIUM"
        mitigation: "Deferred to Epic 1 Story 1.3+ for interactive wizard, color-coded output, and accessibility symbols"
        owner: "Dev Team"
        status: "ACCEPTED"
        justification: "Story 1.1 scope limited to CLI routing framework; full UX implementation in Epic 1 Story 1.3+"

      - risk: "Security injection tests not yet active"
        severity: "LOW"
        mitigation: "Tests implemented (44 tests), activation deferred to Epic 2 when config handling is added"
        owner: "Security Team"
        status: "ACCEPTED"
        justification: "Story 1.1 has stub commands only; injection tests apply to Epic 2 config file validation"

      - risk: "Mutation testing not yet activated"
        severity: "LOW"
        mitigation: "Stryker configured, activation deferred to Epic 1 Story 1.3+ when business logic is implemented"
        owner: "QA Team"
        status: "ACCEPTED"
        justification: "Story 1.1 has minimal business logic (stubs); mutation testing applies to Epic 1 Story 1.3+ and beyond"

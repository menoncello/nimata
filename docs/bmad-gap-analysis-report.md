# BMAD System Gap Analysis Report

**Project:** Nìmata Template Engine CLI
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-28
**Analysis Scope:** BMAD customization, quality gate enforcement, workflow alignment
**Project Type:** TypeScript CLI with strict quality requirements

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis identifies critical gaps in the BMAD system configuration for the Nìmata project. While the project demonstrates strong quality standards in its architecture and agent customizations, significant gaps exist in quality gate enforcement, mutation testing configuration, and workflow compliance that could compromise the project's strict quality requirements.

**Key Findings:**
- **CRITICAL GAP:** No active Stryker configuration despite 80%+ mutation score requirements
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Quality gate enforcement lacks mandatory language in workflows
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Missing eslint-disable prohibition enforcement
- **LOW PRIORITY:** Quick reference inaccuracies with actual workflows

---

## Project Standards Analysis

### Technology Stack & Quality Requirements

Based on the Solution Architecture and PRD analysis:

**Core Quality Standards (Zero-Tolerance):**
- TypeScript: 0 compilation errors (strict mode)
- ESLint: 0 violations (no eslint-disable allowed)
- Tests: 100% pass rate with meaningful assertions
- Mutation Testing: 80%+ score using Stryker
- Code Coverage: Comprehensive acceptance criteria coverage

**Tools & Configuration:**
- Runtime: Bun 1.3+ (native features)
- Test Runner: Bun Test
- Mutation Testing: Stryker 9.x with TypeScript checker
- Linting: ESLint 9.x with strict rules
- Architecture: Clean Architecture Lite (3 layers)
- Monorepo: Turborepo with caching

**Critical Quality Gates (from Solution Architecture):**
1. No eslint-disable comments permitted
2. No @ts-ignore or type assertions allowed
3. All tests must kill mutants (not just achieve coverage)
4. Zero tolerance for TypeScript compilation errors
5. Mandatory mutation testing with 80%+ threshold

---

## Gaps Identified by Category

### 1. CRITICAL GAPS - Mutation Testing Configuration

#### Gap: No Active Stryker Configuration
**Impact:** **BLOCKING** - Cannot enforce 80%+ mutation score requirement

**Evidence:**
- Package.json scripts include `"test:mutation": "stryker run"` in all packages
- **ZERO** Stryker configuration files found across the project
- No stryker.config.js, stryker.config.json, or stryker.config.mjs files
- Solution Architecture specifies 80%+ mutation score as mandatory

**Root Cause:**
- Mutation testing mentioned in quality gate assessments but not configured
- Agent customizations reference Stryker but no actual configuration exists

**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL**
- Project cannot validate test quality
- Mutation testing requirement in quality gates cannot be enforced
- Tests may pass without actually catching bugs

#### Gap: Missing Mutation Testing Thresholds in CI/CD
**Impact:** **HIGH** - No automated enforcement of mutation score requirements

**Evidence:**
- Quality gate assessment shows mutation testing deferred to later stories
- No CI configuration found to enforce mutation thresholds
- No automated mutation score reporting

---

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY GAPS - Quality Gate Enforcement

#### Gap: Workflow Instructions Lack Mandatory Quality Gates
**Impact:** **HIGH** - Quality gates not enforced during story development

**Evidence:**
- `dev-story/instructions.md` Step 4: Generic validation language
- Missing explicit "TypeScript 0 errors, ESLint 0 errors, Tests 100%" requirements
- No mention of mutation testing or 80%+ score requirements
- Quality gate references are conditional rather than mandatory

**Current Language (Step 4):**
```
Run linting and code quality checks if configured
Validate implementation meets ALL story acceptance criteria
```

**Required Language (Missing):**
```
MANDATORY QUALITY GATES:
- TypeScript compilation: MUST have 0 errors
- ESLint violations: MUST have 0 violations (no eslint-disable permitted)
- Tests: MUST pass 100% with meaningful assertions
- Mutation testing: MUST achieve 80%+ score using Stryker
```

#### Gap: No eslint-disable Prohibition Enforcement
**Impact:** **HIGH** - Critical quality standard not enforced

**Evidence:**
- Agent customizations correctly prohibit eslint-disable
- Solution Architecture explicitly forbids eslint-disable
- **Missing:** Workflow enforcement during story development
- **Missing:** Code review checklist items for eslint-disable detection

**Current State:**
- Agent bmm-dev.customize.yaml mentions eslint-disable prohibition
- No automated detection or enforcement in workflows

---

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS - Workflow Compliance

#### Gap: Create Story Workflow Missing Quality Requirements
**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Stories created without explicit quality requirements

**Evidence:**
- `create-story/instructions.md` Step 6: Missing quality gate task creation
- Stories don't automatically include quality validation subtasks
- Acceptance criteria may not reference quality standards

**Current Process:**
```yaml
# Tasks created automatically, but missing quality subtasks:
- [ ] Implement feature X
- [ ] Write tests for feature X
# MISSING:
- [ ] Verify TypeScript 0 errors
- [ ] Verify ESLint 0 violations
- [ ] Run mutation testing, achieve 80%+ score
```

#### Gap: Code Review Workflow Missing Quality Gate Validation
**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Code reviews may miss quality standard violations

**Evidence:**
- `code-review/instructions.md` exists but missing quality gate checklist
- No specific review items for TypeScript/ESLint violations
- No mutation testing score validation in review process

---

### 4. LOW PRIORITY GAPS - Documentation Accuracy

#### Gap: Quick Reference Minor Inaccuracies
**Impact:** **LOW** - Developer confusion in workflow usage

**Evidence:**
- Quick reference shows `*validate-test-quality` workflow (doesn't exist)
- Missing `*code-review` workflow reference
- Mutation testing workflow references not aligned with actual capabilities

**Quick Reference Issues:**
```
# Reference shows:
/bmad:bmm:agents:tea *validate-test-quality  # Workflow doesn't exist

# Should show:
/bmad:bmm:agents:dev *code-review           # For quality validation
```

**File: `apps/cli/stryker.config.js`**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  testRunner: 'command',
  commandRunner: {
    command: 'bun test tests/unit/**/*.test.ts'
  },

  thresholds: {
    high: 80,
    low: 60,
    break: 50
  },
  mutator: {
    plugins: ['@stryker-mutator/typescript-checker']
  },
  reporters: ['progress', 'html', 'clear-text'],

  },
  mutator: {
    plugins: ['@stryker-mutator/typescript-checker']
  },
  reporters: ['progress', 'html', 'clear-text']
};
```

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY - Strengthen Quality Gate Enforcement

**File: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/instructions.md`**
**Section: Step 4 - Replace with mandatory language:**

```markdown
<step n="4" goal="Run MANDATORY quality validations and tests">
  <critical>QUALITY GATES ARE MANDATORY - Story CANNOT proceed without meeting ALL criteria</critical>

  <action>Determine how to run tests for this repo (infer or use {{run_tests_command}} if provided)</action>
  <action>Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions</action>
  <action>Run the new tests to verify implementation correctness</action>

  <!-- MANDATORY QUALITY GATES -->
  <action>Run TypeScript compilation with: tsc --noEmit && tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.test.json</action>
  <check if="TypeScript compilation errors > 0">
    <output>❌ BLOCKING: TypeScript has {{error_count}} compilation errors</output>
    <output>All TypeScript errors must be fixed before proceeding</output>
    <action>HALT: Fix TypeScript errors before continuing</action>
  </check>

  <action>Run ESLint with: eslint "src/**/*.ts" "tests/**/*.ts"</action>
  <check if="ESLint violations > 0">
    <output>❌ BLOCKING: ESLint has {{violation_count}} violations</output>
    <output>All ESLint violations must be fixed, including removal of any eslint-disable comments</output>
    <action>HALT: Fix ESLint violations before continuing</action>
  </check>

  <action>Verify NO eslint-disable comments exist in ANY code files</action>
  <check if="eslint-disable comments found">
    <output>❌ BLOCKING: eslint-disable comments are forbidden in this project</output>
    <output>Remove all eslint-disable comments and fix the underlying issues</output>
    <action>HALT: Remove eslint-disable comments before continuing</action>
  </check>

  <action>Verify NO @ts-ignore or unsafe type assertions exist</action>
  <check if="@ts-ignore or unsafe type assertions found">
    <output>❌ BLOCKING: @ts-ignore and unsafe type assertions are forbidden</output>
    <output>Remove all @ts-ignore and use proper TypeScript type safety</output>
    <action>HALT: Fix type safety issues before continuing</action>
  </check>

  <action>Run mutation testing with: bun run test:mutation</action>
  <check if="mutation score < 80">
    <output>❌ BLOCKING: Mutation testing score is {{score}}% (required: 80%+)</output>
    <output>Improve test quality to kill more mutants before proceeding</output>
    <action>HALT: Improve test quality before continuing</action>
  </check>

  <action>Validate implementation meets ALL story acceptance criteria; if ACs include quantitative thresholds (e.g., test pass rate), ensure they are met before marking complete</action>
  <action if="regression tests fail">STOP and fix before continuing, consider how current changes made broke regression</action>
  <action if="new tests fail">STOP and fix before continuing</action>

  <output>✅ All quality gates PASSED:
  - TypeScript: 0 compilation errors
  - ESLint: 0 violations
  - Quality: No eslint-disable or @ts-ignore
  - Mutation: {{mutation_score}}% score (≥80% required)
  - Tests: 100% pass rate
  </output>
</step>
```

### 3. HIGH PRIORITY - Update Create Story Workflow

**File: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/instructions.md`**
**Section: Step 6 - Add quality gate task requirements:**

```markdown
<step n="6" goal="Assemble acceptance criteria and tasks with MANDATORY quality requirements">
  <action>Assemble acceptance criteria list from tech_spec or epics. If gaps exist, derive minimal, testable criteria from PRD verbatim phrasing (NO invention).</action>

  <!-- MANDATORY QUALITY GATE TASKS -->
  <action>Create tasks/subtasks directly mapped to ACs. MUST include the following quality validation subtasks for EVERY implementation task:</action>
  <template-output file="{default_output_file}">acceptance_criteria</template-output>
  <template-output file="{default_output_file}">tasks_subtasks</template-output>

  <!-- Quality gate tasks automatically added to each story -->
  <action>For each implementation task, automatically add these quality validation subtasks:</action>
  <template-output file="{default_output_file}">quality_gate_tasks</template-output>
</step>
```

**Add new template for quality gate tasks:**

```markdown
<!-- Template: quality_gate_tasks -->
### Quality Validation Subtasks (MANDATORY)

For every implementation task, add these subtasks:

- [ ] **TypeScript Validation**: Run `tsc --noEmit && tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.test.json` - Must have 0 errors
- [ ] **ESLint Validation**: Run `eslint "src/**/*.ts" "tests/**/*.ts"` - Must have 0 violations
- [ ] **Code Quality Check**: Verify NO eslint-disable comments exist in any code
- [ ] **Type Safety Check**: Verify NO @ts-ignore or unsafe type assertions
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Run `bun test` - Must have 100% pass rate
- [ ] **Mutation Testing**: Run `bun run test:mutation` - Must achieve 80%+ score
- [ ] **Code Review**: Run code review workflow for quality gate validation

**Note**: These subtasks are MANDATORY and cannot be skipped. Story cannot be marked complete unless all quality validation subtasks pass.
```

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY - Strengthen Code Review Workflow

**File: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/code-review/instructions.md`**
**Add quality gate checklist section:**

```markdown
## MANDATORY Quality Gate Checklist

### TypeScript Quality Gates
- [ ] **TypeScript Compilation**: 0 errors in both src and tests
- [ ] **Type Safety**: No @ts-ignore or unsafe type assertions
- [ ] **Interface Naming**: No Hungarian notation (IFoo), use PascalCase
- [ ] **Null Safety**: No non-null assertions (!), use proper guards

### ESLint Quality Gates
- [ ] **ESLint Violations**: 0 violations in source and test files
- [ ] **eslint-disable Comments**: ZERO tolerance - must remove all
- [ ] **Code Complexity**: Functions ≤10 complexity, ≤30 lines
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Proper variable/function naming

### Test Quality Gates
- [ ] **Test Pass Rate**: 100% of tests passing
- [ ] **Test Assertions**: Meaningful assertions, not just coverage
- [ ] **Mutation Testing**: 80%+ score achieved
- [ ] **Test Isolation**: No test dependencies or shared state

### Security Quality Gates
- [ ] **No Secrets**: No hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All external inputs validated
- [ ] **Dependencies**: No known vulnerabilities

**BLOCKING CONDITIONS:**
- ANY quality gate failure = BLOCK story completion
- eslint-disable comments = IMMEDIATE rejection
- TypeScript errors = IMMEDIATE rejection
- Mutation score < 80% = IMMEDIATE rejection
```

### 5. LOW PRIORITY - Fix Quick Reference

**File: `docs/bmad-quick-reference.md`**
**Update workflow references:**

```markdown
# 4. Quality Checks
/bmad:bmm:agents:tea *test-review X.X
/bmad:bmm:agents:dev *code-review X.X  # Added - for quality validation

# 5. Quality Gate (P0/P1 stories)
/bmad:bmm:agents:tea *trace X.X
/bmad:bmm:agents:tea *nfr-assess X.X

# Mutation testing with Stryker (80%+ threshold required)
# Run via: bun run test:mutation (automatically enforced in dev-story workflow)
```

# Nìmata Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Eduardo
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project Level:** 2
**Project Type:** cli
**Target Scale:** 5-15 stories, 1-2 epics, focused PRD + solutioning handoff

---

## Description, Context and Goals

Nìmata is a BunJS-powered CLI tool that transforms code quality from an aspiration into an automatic reality through a three-pillar quality cascade: **Start Right** (quality-first scaffolding), **Find Right** (orchestrated validation), and **Fix Right** (intelligent refactoring triage).

**The Problem We Solve:**

AI-assisted TypeScript/JavaScript developers face three compounding pain points:

1. **Context Alignment Problem:** 10-30 minutes wasted daily re-explaining project context to AI assistants
2. **Quality Snowball Effect:** Projects without upfront quality configuration accumulate exponential technical debt
3. **Inefficient Fix Workflow:** Simple fixes consume expensive AI prompts when static tools could handle them in milliseconds

**Our Solution:**

Nìmata orchestrates the complete quality workflow from project inception through ongoing maintenance. It scaffolds TypeScript+Bun projects with comprehensive quality tooling pre-configured (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Bun Test), generates persistent AI rules files (CLAUDE.md, BMAD configs) to eliminate context re-establishment overhead, validates code through unified orchestration, and intelligently routes simple fixes to static refactoring while generating AI prompts for complex improvements.

**Key Differentiators:**

- Only tool combining quality-first scaffolding + AI integration + intelligent refactoring triage
- Orchestration over invention: leverages battle-tested tools rather than building proprietary alternatives
- AI-native by design: first-class support for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf
- Intelligent cost optimization: static-first approach saves time and AI API costs
- Quality cascade effect: better setup → fewer issues → easier fixes

### Deployment Intent

**MVP for Early Users** - The initial release targets quality-conscious AI-assisted developers who value productivity and are willing to adopt new tools. This is a functional MVP focused on validating the core three-pillar value proposition (Start Right → Find Right → Fix Right) with real users.

**Timeline:** 6-month development cycle leading to public release on npm
**Distribution:** Open-source core published to npm registry and GitHub
**Support Level:** Community support via GitHub Issues, Discord community, comprehensive documentation
**Success Criteria:** 500+ active users within 6 months, 60% retention rate, NPS 40+

### Context

**Why Now:**

- AI-assisted development has become standard practice (60%+ of developers use AI tools in 2025)
- Quality debt accumulates faster in AI-assisted workflows without proper guardrails
- Static analysis tools are mature and reliable but underutilized in modern workflows
- No existing tool addresses the complete quality workflow (setup → validate → fix)

**Market Opportunity:**
Growing intersection of three trends: (1) rapid AI coding assistant adoption, (2) TypeScript/Bun ecosystem maturation, and (3) developer demand for productivity tooling that "just works." Existing scaffolding tools (Yeoman, Plop) lack AI integration and quality orchestration. AI assistants (Claude Code, Copilot) lack persistent project context and quality guardrails.

### Goals

**Primary Goal 1: Eliminate AI Context Re-establishment Overhead**

- Generate persistent AI rules files (CLAUDE.md, BMAD configs) during project scaffolding
- Reduce developer time spent re-explaining project context by 60%+
- Enable AI assistants to follow project standards 80%+ of the time without re-prompting
- **Success Metric:** Users report saving 15-20 minutes per day on context management

**Primary Goal 2: Make Quality Automatic from Day One**

- Scaffold TypeScript+Bun projects with comprehensive quality tooling pre-configured
- Reduce project setup time from 2-4 hours to under 20 minutes
- Achieve 90%+ of scaffolded projects passing all quality checks immediately after setup
- **Success Metric:** 80%+ of users choose "strict" quality level (validates opinionated defaults work)

**Primary Goal 3: Optimize Fix Workflow with Intelligent Triage**

- Route simple fixes to static refactoring (milliseconds) vs AI prompts (seconds/cost)
- Enable developers to fix 70%+ of simple issues via static refactoring
- Generate formatted AI prompts for complex refactoring that require human judgment
- **Success Metric:** Users complete simple fixes 10x faster than manual AI prompting

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Pillar 1: Start Right (Scaffolding)**

**FR001: Interactive CLI Project Scaffolding**
User can run `nimata init` and be guided through an interactive CLI wizard that asks context-aware questions to configure a new TypeScript+Bun project with opinionated directory structure, dependency management (package.json, tsconfig.json), and SOLID architecture.

**FR002: Quality Tool Configuration**
System automatically configures ESLint, TypeScript compiler, Bun Test, and Prettier during scaffolding with opinionated defaults that enforce best practices (no `any`, readonly where possible, test coverage requirements).

**FR003: AI Rules File Generation**
System generates persistent AI context files (CLAUDE.md, BMAD agent configurations) during project setup that encode project structure, architecture decisions, coding standards, and constraints to reduce AI hallucinations.

**FR004: Configurable Quality Levels**
User can select from three preset quality configurations (Light, Medium, Strict) during scaffolding, with Strict as the recommended default. User can easily switch between levels post-scaffolding via configuration file.

**Pillar 2: Find Right (Validation)**

**FR005: Unified Quality Validation Command**
User can run single command `nimata validate` that orchestrates execution of all configured quality tools (ESLint, TypeScript, Bun Test, Prettier) and presents unified results in CLI with clear summary of issues found.

**FR006: Enhanced Validation Reporting**
System provides dual-layer reporting: (1) CLI summary showing quick overview of pass/fail status by tool, and (2) detailed issue listing with file paths, line numbers, and actionable descriptions of what needs fixing.

**FR007: Quality Tool Orchestration**
System intelligently runs quality tools in parallel where possible to minimize total validation time, aggregates errors across tools, and provides unified exit codes for CI/CD integration.

**Pillar 3: Fix Right (Refactoring)**

**FR008: Static Refactoring Engine**
User can run `nimata fix` to automatically apply simple refactoring patterns (readonly variables, const declarations, arrow function conversions) using AST-based safe transformations across selected scope (file, directory, or project).

**FR009: Interactive Refactoring Preview**
System shows interactive diff preview of proposed static refactoring changes before applying them, allowing user to review and approve/reject changes to build trust through transparency.

**FR010: AI Prompt Generation for Complex Refactoring**
System identifies complex refactoring scenarios beyond static capabilities (method extraction, complexity reduction, architectural changes) and generates formatted prompts with code context for Claude Code, Copilot, or Windsurf that user can copy and paste.

**FR011: Intelligent Triage Routing**
System automatically categorizes issues discovered during validation as either "simple" (can be fixed by static refactoring) or "complex" (requires AI assistance), routing user to appropriate fix workflow to optimize for speed and cost.

**Cross-Cutting Requirements**

**FR012: Project Templates Extension System**
System provides SOLID architecture enabling future addition of new tech stack templates (React, Vue, Node.js) without requiring core engine modifications, with clear plugin interface for community contributions.

**FR013: Configuration Management**
User can store and modify Nìmata configuration in local `.nimatarc` file within project, enabling version control of quality settings and project-specific customizations.

**FR014: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
System works reliably on macOS (10.15+), Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), and Windows (10/11 with WSL2), with platform-specific handling of file paths and terminal output.

**FR015: Offline Capability**
System functions fully offline after initial installation, with all templates, rules library, and tooling bundled locally, requiring internet only for initial npm install and optional tool updates.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR001: Performance - Fast Feedback Loops**

- Project scaffolding completes in <30 seconds for typical TypeScript+Bun CLI project
- Quality validation returns results in <30 seconds for projects up to 10,000 lines of code
- **Intelligent caching:** System maintains cache of validation results per file with hash-based invalidation, only re-analyzing files that have changed since last validation
- Cache stores file hash + timestamp + validation results, dramatically improving performance for incremental validation runs
- Static refactoring applies changes in <5 seconds per file
- Memory footprint remains <200MB during normal operation
- **Rationale:** Fast feedback is critical to maintaining developer flow state and encouraging frequent validation. Caching prevents redundant analysis of unchanged files, enabling sub-second validation for typical workflow (developer changes 1-3 files between runs).

**NFR002: Reliability - Zero-Defect Scaffolding**

- Scaffolded projects must compile and pass all quality checks 100% of the time immediately after creation
- Static refactoring transformations must never introduce syntax errors or break existing functionality
- System must handle edge cases gracefully (missing dependencies, disk space issues, permission errors) with clear error messages
- Cache invalidation must be reliable - never serve stale results when file has been modified
- **Rationale:** Trust is paramount - developers must be confident that Nìmata won't break their code or provide incorrect validation results

**NFR003: Usability - Intuitive CLI Experience**

- Interactive CLI wizard completes project setup in <20 questions with smart defaults
- CLI output must be color-coded with symbols for accessibility (screen reader friendly)
- Error messages must be actionable, explaining what went wrong and how to fix it
- Documentation must enable new user to scaffold first project within 10 minutes of discovering tool
- **Rationale:** Low friction adoption is essential for developer tools - if setup is confusing, users abandon immediately

**NFR004: Maintainability - Extensible Architecture**

- Core engine follows SOLID principles to enable addition of new tech stacks without modifying core code
- Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage (>80%) to catch regressions
- Clear separation between core orchestration, plugins (scaffolding/validation/refactoring), and templates
- Caching system designed as pluggable module, enabling different cache strategies (memory, disk, redis) in future
- **Rationale:** MVP is just the beginning - architecture must support Phase 2 expansion without rewrites

**NFR005: Security - Safe by Default**

- No scaffolded project should contain hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- All dependencies must be vetted and regularly audited for vulnerabilities (Dependabot integration)
- Static refactoring operates in safe mode: changes can always be reverted, never modifies files without explicit user approval
- Cache files stored in project-local `.nimata/cache/` directory, never contain sensitive data, can be safely gitignored
- **Rationale:** Security breaches or data loss would destroy trust and adoption

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Creating a New Quality-First TypeScript CLI Project (Primary Use Case)

**Persona:** Alex, a mid-level TypeScript developer who uses Claude Code daily and wants to build a new CLI tool without spending hours on setup.

**Context:** Alex has an idea for a CLI utility and wants to start coding quickly, but knows from experience that skipping quality setup leads to technical debt. Previous projects took 2-3 hours just to configure linting, testing, and formatting.

**Steps:**

1. **Discover & Install**
   - Alex finds Nìmata via Reddit recommendation or newsletter
   - Runs `npm install -g nimata` to install globally
   - Takes <2 minutes

2. **Initialize Project**
   - Runs `nimata init my-cli-tool` in terminal
   - Interactive wizard asks key questions with inline help:
     - Project name: `my-cli-tool`
     - Description: `A utility for managing dev environments`
     - Quality level: Shows options with `[?]` help available
       - `Light` - Basic linting and formatting [?]
       - `Medium` - Standard quality checks + tests [?]
       - `Strict` - Comprehensive quality enforcement + mutation testing ⭐ [?]
     - Selects `Strict` and presses `[?]` to see: "Includes ESLint strict rules, TypeScript strict mode, 80%+ test coverage requirement, Prettier, and Stryker mutation testing to ensure tests actually catch bugs"
     - AI assistants in use (multi-select): Checks `Claude Code` and `GitHub Copilot`
   - Wizard completes in <5 minutes with ~15 questions
   - System scaffolds complete project structure with all quality tools configured

3. **Verify Setup**
   - Alex opens project in VSCode
   - Runs `nimata validate` to verify everything works
   - All checks pass immediately: ✓ ESLint ✓ TypeScript ✓ Tests ✓ Prettier ✓ Mutation Coverage
   - Opens generated `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` files, sees clear project context and coding standards for both AI tools
   - **Outcome:** Project is ready to code in <10 minutes total (vs 2-4 hours manual setup)

4. **Develop with AI Assistance**
   - Alex starts implementing feature using Claude Code
   - Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` and follows project standards automatically
   - Switches to GitHub Copilot for some inline completions - it also respects project rules
   - AI-generated code respects linting rules, no `any` types, proper test patterns
   - Alex runs `nimata validate` frequently (completes in <5 seconds due to caching)
   - **Outcome:** No context re-establishment overhead, AI code passes quality checks first try 80%+ of time

5. **Fix Issues with Intelligent Triage**
   - Validation finds 3 simple issues (missing readonly, var instead of const)
   - Alex runs `nimata fix --preview` to see proposed changes
   - Reviews diff, approves changes, fixes apply instantly
   - Validation also identifies 1 complex issue (function too complex, needs refactoring)
   - Alex runs `nimata prompt --complexity` to generate AI refactoring prompt
   - Copies prompt to Claude Code, gets intelligent refactoring suggestions
   - **Outcome:** Simple fixes automated in seconds, complex issues get proper AI attention

6. **Validate Test Quality with Mutation Testing**
   - Alex runs full validation including mutation testing: `nimata validate --full`
   - Stryker mutation testing reveals that some tests don't actually catch bugs (mutants survived)
   - Alex strengthens tests based on mutation report
   - Re-runs validation, mutation coverage improves to 85%
   - **Outcome:** Confidence that tests actually work, not just provide coverage numbers

7. **Continuous Quality**
   - Throughout development, Alex runs `nimata validate` before commits (fast mode, no mutation tests)
   - Caching makes incremental validation near-instant (<2 seconds)
   - Runs `nimata validate --full` weekly to check mutation coverage
   - Quality remains high without slowing down development velocity
   - **Outcome:** Technical debt prevented, not accumulated

**Journey Success Metrics:**

- Time from install to first commit: <20 minutes (vs 2-4 hours manual)
- AI context re-establishment overhead: Eliminated (saved 15-20 min/day)
- Quality tool compliance: 95%+ from day one (vs 60-70% typical)
- Multiple AI assistants supported seamlessly with consistent context
- Test quality validated through mutation testing, not just coverage
- Developer satisfaction: "I can focus on solving problems, not configuring tools"

## UX Design Principles

**1. Progressive Disclosure - Complexity on Demand**

- Present simple, clear defaults first; reveal advanced options only when requested
- Interactive wizard uses smart defaults (e.g., Strict quality level) with `[?]` help available for those who want details
- CLI commands work with zero flags for common cases (`nimata validate`), but accept flags for power users (`nimata validate --full --reporter=html`)
- **Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load for new users while maintaining power user flexibility

**2. Fast Feedback - Instant Gratification**

- Every command provides immediate visual feedback (spinners during work, checkmarks/crosses for results)
- Validation shows progress incrementally: "✓ ESLint passed (2.1s)" as each tool completes
- Cache-powered incremental validation feels instant (<2s) for typical workflow
- **Rationale:** Fast feedback maintains flow state and encourages frequent validation

**3. Transparency & Trust - No Magic, Only Clarity**

- Always show what Nìmata is doing and why (e.g., "Running ESLint on 23 files...")
- Static refactoring shows full diff preview before applying changes
- Configuration files are plain text (YAML/JSON), fully readable and version-controllable
- Never modify user code without explicit approval
- **Rationale:** Developers need to trust tools that touch their code; transparency builds trust

**4. Actionable Errors - Problems → Solutions**

- Error messages explain what went wrong AND how to fix it
- Example: "ESLint found 3 issues. Run `nimata fix` to auto-fix simple issues, or `nimata prompt --lint` for AI assistance with complex ones."
- Include relevant file paths with line numbers (src/index.ts:42) for immediate navigation
- **Rationale:** Errors should guide users toward solutions, not leave them stuck

**5. Consistent Language - Speak Developer**

- Use terminology developers already know (lint, validate, refactor) not invented jargon
- Command structure follows Unix conventions (`nimata <verb> <noun>` pattern)
- Output uses standard exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure) for CI/CD integration
- **Rationale:** Minimize learning curve by aligning with existing mental models

## Epics

**Epic Overview:**

Nìmata MVP is organized into 3 primary epics aligned with the three-pillar quality cascade. While epics deliver sequentially for coherent user value, stories within each epic are highly granular and parallelizable, enabling 4-5 developers to work simultaneously with minimal blocking dependencies.

**Epic 1: Start Right - Quality-First Scaffolding**

- **Goal:** Enable developers to scaffold TypeScript+Bun CLI projects with comprehensive quality tooling and AI context files pre-configured
- **Value:** Eliminates 2-4 hours of manual setup, generates persistent AI context (Claude Code & GitHub Copilot) to reduce hallucinations
- **Stories:** 10 stories designed for parallel development
  - **Foundation (can start immediately, Dev 1):** CLI framework setup, command routing, config system
  - **Scaffolding (parallel, Dev 2):** Interactive wizard, directory structure, template engine
  - **Quality Config (parallel, Dev 3):** ESLint config generation, TypeScript config, Prettier setup, Bun Test setup
  - **AI Rules (parallel, Dev 4):** Rules library, CLAUDE.md generation, GitHub Copilot instructions
  - **Integration (Dev 5):** Quality level presets (Light/Medium/Strict), end-to-end init command
- **Estimated Effort:** ~35% of development effort
- **Delivery:** Enables "nimata init" complete workflow

**Epic 2: Find Right - Unified Quality Validation**

- **Goal:** Orchestrate multiple quality tools (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Bun Test) through single command with intelligent caching
- **Value:** Single-command validation with fast incremental feedback (<2s for unchanged files)
- **Stories:** 10 stories designed for parallel development
  - **Tool Integrations (parallel, Devs 1-4):** ESLint integration, TypeScript integration, Prettier integration, Bun Test integration (4 devs, 1 tool each)
  - **Orchestration (Dev 5):** Parallel execution engine, result aggregation, CLI reporting
  - **Performance (Dev 3):** File hashing system, cache storage layer, cache invalidation logic
  - **Reporting (Dev 2):** Unified CLI output, error formatting with file:line references
- **Estimated Effort:** ~35% of development effort
- **Delivery:** Enables "nimata validate" complete workflow

**Epic 3: Fix Right - Intelligent Refactoring & Triage**

- **Goal:** Implement intelligent triage that routes simple fixes to static refactoring and complex issues to AI-assisted refactoring
- **Value:** 10x faster fixes for simple issues, AI prompts (Claude Code & Copilot format) for complex refactoring
- **Stories:** 10 stories designed for parallel development
  - **Static Refactoring (parallel, Devs 1-2):** AST parser setup, readonly enforcement, const promotion, arrow functions, unused imports removal
  - **AI Prompt Generation (parallel, Dev 3):** Prompt templates, context extraction, Claude Code format, GitHub Copilot format
  - **Triage Engine (Dev 4):** Issue categorization, complexity analysis, routing logic
  - **UX (Dev 5):** Interactive preview, diff display, approve/reject flow
- **Estimated Effort:** ~30% of development effort
- **Delivery:** Enables "nimata fix" and "nimata prompt" complete workflows

**Parallelization Details:**

Each epic's stories are organized into **swim lanes** that minimize dependencies:

- **Lane A (Infrastructure):** Framework, orchestration, core systems
- **Lane B (Integrations):** Tool integrations, external APIs
- **Lane C (Intelligence):** Analysis, categorization, AI features
- **Lane D (Configuration):** Config generation, presets, templates
- **Lane E (UX):** CLI output, interactive flows, reporting

**Total Stories:** 30 stories across 3 epics
**Average Story Size:** 2-4 days of development
**Team Velocity:** With 5 devs, ~10-12 stories per 2-week sprint

**Delivery Timeline:**

- **Sprint 1-2:** Epic 1 (10 stories, 5 devs in parallel)
- **Sprint 3-4:** Epic 2 (10 stories, 5 devs in parallel)
- **Sprint 5-6:** Epic 3 (10 stories, 5 devs in parallel)
- **Sprint 7:** Integration, polish, documentation

**Post-MVP Expansion:** Windsurf support can be added in Phase 2 as additional AI assistant adapter.

_Detailed epic breakdown with story swim lanes, acceptance criteria, and dependencies in: `epic-stories.md`_

## Out of Scope

**Deferred to Post-MVP (Phase 2+):**

**Additional Tech Stacks:**

- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte frontend frameworks
- Express, Fastify, NestJS backend frameworks
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis database setups
- Monorepo scaffolding (Nx, Turborepo)
- **Rationale:** MVP focuses on TypeScript+Bun CLI projects only. Extensible architecture allows adding stacks in Phase 2 without core rewrites.

**Additional AI Assistants:**

- Windsurf integration
- Cursor integration
- Cody integration
- Custom AI assistant adapters
- **Rationale:** Claude Code + GitHub Copilot cover 80%+ of AI-assisted developers. Additional assistants can be added via adapter pattern post-MVP.

**Advanced Refactoring Features:**

- IDE-style complex refactorings (extract method, inline variable)
- Automated structural refactoring (reduce complexity, reorganize imports)
- Cross-file refactoring (rename across project)
- Safe rename with type awareness
- **Rationale:** Simple static refactorings prove concept. Complex features require mature AST manipulation foundation.

**HTML Reports & Visualization:**

- Stryker-style HTML reports for validation results
- Quality trend tracking dashboards
- Visual diff previews for refactorings
- Export reports for team sharing
- **Rationale:** CLI output sufficient for MVP. HTML reports add significant dev time, deferred to Phase 2.

**Mutation Testing:**

- Stryker mutation testing integration
- Mutation coverage reporting
- Automated test quality validation
- **Rationale:** Added complexity, slower validation. Core test coverage sufficient for MVP validation.

**Team & Enterprise Features:**

- Team collaboration and shared templates
- Custom organizational rule libraries
- Usage analytics and reporting dashboards
- SSO, compliance, audit logging
- **Rationale:** Solve for individual developers first. Enterprise features come after PMF validation.

**Developer Environment Features:**

- IDE settings/extensions configuration
- Docker container setup
- Database schema scaffolding
- CI/CD pipeline generation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- **Rationale:** Scope creep. Focus on code quality cascade, not full environment orchestration.

**Advanced Integration Features:**

- Git hooks automatic installation (pre-commit, pre-push)
- VSCode/JetBrains IDE plugins
- Deep IDE integrations (inline warnings)
- Real-time validation as you type
- **Rationale:** CLI-first approach works standalone. IDE integrations add platform-specific complexity.

**Project Migration & Audit:**

- Scan existing projects for quality gaps
- Generate migration plan to adopt Nìmata standards
- Health check scoring for brownfield projects
- Automated PR generation for quality improvements
- **Rationale:** MVP targets greenfield projects. Brownfield migration is Phase 2 feature.

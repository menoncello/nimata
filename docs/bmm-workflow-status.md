## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** cli (CLI Tool - Command-line tools and utilities)
- **Project Level:** 2 (Medium project with multiple features/epics)
- **Instruction Set:** Phases 2 → 4 (skip Phase 3: Solutioning)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** CLI tool project (Level 2 - Medium complexity)
- **Estimated Stories:** TBD (will be determined in Phase 2: Planning)
- **Estimated Epics:** Multiple epics expected
- **Timeline:** TBD

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** None (greenfield project)
- **Team Size:** TBD
- **Deployment Intent:** TBD
- **UI Components:** No (CLI-only interface)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 1 (Analysis):**

- Brainstorming session output
- Research findings (optional)
- Product Brief

**Phase 2 (Planning):**

- Tech-Spec (Level 2 project)
- Epic breakdown
- Story sequence

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**

- Story drafts
- Implementation code
- Completed features

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 1: Analysis** (Current Phase)
   - Start with `brainstorm-project` to explore CLI tool ideas
   - Optionally conduct `research` for market/technical validation
   - Complete with `product-brief` for strategic foundation

2. **Phase 2: Planning**
   - Run `plan-project` to create Tech-Spec and story breakdown
   - Final project level will be confirmed (expected: Level 2)

3. **Phase 3: Solutioning**
   - SKIPPED for Level 2 projects

4. **Phase 4: Implementation**
   - Iterative story development using SM and DEV agents

### Next Actions

1. Run `*brainstorm-project` with Analyst agent (you can do this now!)
2. After brainstorming, decide whether to run optional `*research`
3. Complete Phase 1 with `*product-brief`
4. Move to Phase 2 with `*plan-project` (PM agent)

## Special Considerations

- **CLI-focused:** No UX specification workflow needed
- **Greenfield:** No existing codebase documentation required
- **Level 2:** Streamlined path without architecture phase
- **Analysis First:** Full exploration and validation before planning

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Project Type: CLI Tool
- No visual UI components
- Command-line interface only

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 2+ (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md

Includes 8 documentation artifacts (ADRs, tech specs, PRD sections), 12 architectural constraints, 4 interface definitions, complete dependency tree (Yargs 17.x, TSyringe 4.x, Bun 1.3+), and comprehensive test strategy mapped to 6 acceptance criteria. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed dev-story for Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup). Implemented complete Turborepo monorepo structure with apps/cli, packages/core, and packages/adapters. Created CLI entry point with Yargs command routing (init, validate, fix, prompt), TSyringe DI container, global flags (--help, --version, --config), and Unix-compliant exit codes. All 7 task groups completed with 43 subtasks. Test suite: 29 unit tests + 22 E2E tests = 51 total tests, all passing 100%. All 6 acceptance criteria met. Key decisions: Used import.meta.main for test isolation, created separate constants.ts for EXIT_CODES, bin/nimata spawns compiled dist/index.js, fixed Turborepo "tasks" field.

- **2025-10-16**: Completed story-context for Story 1.2 (Configuration System). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.1.2.xml. Includes 6 documentation artifacts (ADRs, tech specs, PRD sections), 12 architectural constraints, 3 interface definitions, complete dependency tree (TSyringe 4.x, Zod 3.x, Bun 1.3+ native YAML), and comprehensive test strategy mapped to 6 acceptance criteria + NFR requirements. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
- **2025-10-17**: Completed review-story for Story 1.2 (Configuration System). Review outcome: Changes Requested. All 6 acceptance criteria functionally met, but 3 HIGH blockers found: (1) ADR-001 violation - uses js-yaml instead of Bun.file().yaml(), (2) Missing dependency - js-yaml not in adapters/package.json, (3) 30 ESLint violations in yaml-config-repository.ts. TypeScript compiles cleanly. P0 tasks completed (security limits, performance, deep merge). Action items: 7 total (3 P0 blocking, 4 P1 deferred). Story status reverted to "In Progress". Next: DEV agent fixes P0 blockers, re-runs ESLint/TypeScript checks.
- **2025-10-17**: Completed review-story #2 for Story 1.2 (Configuration System). Review outcome: ✅ Approved. Previous review had false positives - code already uses Bun.YAML.parse() (ADR-001 compliant), 0 ESLint errors, no js-yaml dependency. All 6 acceptance criteria met, 190 tests passing (66 E2E deferred to P1-2/Story 1.3+). Clean architecture verified, security features complete, TypeScript/ESLint clean. Story status updated to "Review Passed". Next: Run story-approved workflow to move Story 1.2 → DONE.
- **2025-10-17**: Story 1.2 (Configuration System) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Story 1.3 moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Story 1.4 moved from BACKLOG → TODO.

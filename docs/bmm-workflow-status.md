### Next Action Required

**What to do next:** Story 1.2 (Configuration System) is drafted but needs SM review and approval before development can begin.

**Next Steps:**
1. Load SM agent
2. Review Story 1.2 draft at `docs/stories/story-1.2.md`
3. Run `story-ready` workflow to approve it for development
4. Then DEV agent can implement Story 1.2

**Command to run:** Load SM agent and run `story-ready` workflow

**Agent to load:** bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md (SM agent)

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** cli (CLI Tool - Command-line tools and utilities)
- **Project Level:** 2 (Medium project with multiple features/epics)
- **Instruction Set:** Phases 2 → 4 (skip Phase 3: Solutioning)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** CLI tool project (Level 2 - Medium complexity)
- **Estimated Stories:** TBD (will be determined in Phase 2: Planning)
- **Estimated Epics:** Multiple epics expected
- **Timeline:** TBD

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** None (greenfield project)
- **Team Size:** TBD
- **Deployment Intent:** TBD
- **UI Components:** No (CLI-only interface)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 1 (Analysis):**

- Brainstorming session output
- Research findings (optional)
- Product Brief

**Phase 2 (Planning):**

- Tech-Spec (Level 2 project)
- Epic breakdown
- Story sequence

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**

- Story drafts
- Implementation code
- Completed features

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 1: Analysis** (Current Phase)
   - Start with `brainstorm-project` to explore CLI tool ideas
   - Optionally conduct `research` for market/technical validation
   - Complete with `product-brief` for strategic foundation

2. **Phase 2: Planning**
   - Run `plan-project` to create Tech-Spec and story breakdown
   - Final project level will be confirmed (expected: Level 2)

3. **Phase 3: Solutioning**
   - SKIPPED for Level 2 projects

4. **Phase 4: Implementation**
   - Iterative story development using SM and DEV agents

### Next Actions

1. Run `*brainstorm-project` with Analyst agent (you can do this now!)
2. After brainstorming, decide whether to run optional `*research`
3. Complete Phase 1 with `*product-brief`
4. Move to Phase 2 with `*plan-project` (PM agent)

## Special Considerations

- **CLI-focused:** No UX specification workflow needed
- **Greenfield:** No existing codebase documentation required
- **Level 2:** Streamlined path without architecture phase
- **Analysis First:** Full exploration and validation before planning

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Project Type: CLI Tool
- No visual UI components
- Command-line interface only

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 2+ (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-16**: Project identified as Level 2 CLI tool (greenfield)
- **2025-10-16**: Analysis Phase selected as starting point
- **2025-10-16**: brainstorm-project chosen as first workflow
- **2025-10-16**: Completed brainstorm-project workflow. Generated 39 concepts across 3 techniques (First Principles, SCAMPER, What If Scenarios). Identified 6 essential MVP features and clear roadmap. Next: product-brief workflow.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed product-brief workflow. Created comprehensive Product Brief defining target users (AI-assisted TypeScript/Bun developers), three-pillar quality cascade (Start Right → Find Right → Fix Right), 6 MVP core features, financial projections, risks, and strategic roadmap. Key decision: Using Bun Test (v1.1.3+) instead of Vitest for testing. Next: plan-project workflow to create Tech-Spec.
- **2025-10-16**: Started plan-project workflow. Routing to PRD workflow based on Level 2 cli project.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed plan-project workflow. Generated comprehensive PRD with 15 functional requirements, 5 non-functional requirements, detailed user journey, and 3 epics containing 30 parallelizable stories. Epic structure designed for 4-5 developers working concurrently. Key additions: Intelligent caching system for validation, multi-AI assistant support (Claude Code + GitHub Copilot), mutation testing consideration moved to Phase 2. Next: 3-solutioning workflow for architecture and technical specifications.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed solution-architecture workflow. Generated comprehensive solution architecture (58 pages) with Clean Architecture Lite (3 layers), 12 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), complete technology stack with specific versions (Bun 1.3+, TypeScript 5.x, Turborepo 2.x, TSyringe 4.x, ts-morph 22.x), proposed source tree, and 29 components mapped to 30 stories. Cohesion check: 100% requirements coverage (20/20), 100% story readiness (30/30), 100% technology specificity (22/22). Generated 3 tech specs (Epic 1: 81KB, Epic 2: 85KB, Epic 3: 82KB) with complete TypeScript interfaces, implementation patterns, testing strategies, and swim lane assignments for 4-5 developers. Key architectural decisions: SQLite caching with WAL mode (3-6x faster), Bun native APIs (40-60% performance improvement), Clean Architecture Lite (simplified from 4 to 3 layers), TSyringe manual registration, ts-morph for safe AST transformations. Next: Phase 4 Implementation - Sprint 0 foundation setup.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed create-story workflow for Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.1.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story extracted from epic-stories.md (Story 1.1) and tech-spec-epic-1.md. Includes 6 acceptance criteria, 7 task groups with detailed subtasks, architecture patterns (Clean Architecture Lite, Yargs, TSyringe), testing strategy, and references to source documents. Next: Review story and run story-ready to approve for development.
- **2025-10-16**: Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Next story 1.2 (Configuration System) remains in TODO for future drafting.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed story-context for Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.1.1.xml. Includes 8 documentation artifacts (ADRs, tech specs, PRD sections), 12 architectural constraints, 4 interface definitions, complete dependency tree (Yargs 17.x, TSyringe 4.x, Bun 1.3+), and comprehensive test strategy mapped to 6 acceptance criteria. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed dev-story for Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup). Implemented complete Turborepo monorepo structure with apps/cli, packages/core, and packages/adapters. Created CLI entry point with Yargs command routing (init, validate, fix, prompt), TSyringe DI container, global flags (--help, --version, --config), and Unix-compliant exit codes. All 7 task groups completed with 43 subtasks. Test suite: 29 unit tests + 22 E2E tests = 51 total tests, all passing 100%. All 6 acceptance criteria met. Key decisions: Used import.meta.main for test isolation, created separate constants.ts for EXIT_CODES, bin/nimata spawns compiled dist/index.js, fixed Turborepo "tasks" field. Story status: Ready for Review. Next: User review and story-approved workflow.
- **2025-10-16**: Completed review-story for Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup). Review outcome: Changes Requested. All 6 acceptance criteria functionally met, 137 tests passing, TypeScript compiles without errors. However, 12 ESLint violations block production: app.test.ts (550 lines, max 300; nested functions >4 levels), command tests (8 empty arrow functions), index.test.ts (2 callback nesting violations). Architectural alignment verified: Clean Architecture Lite, TSyringe DI, Yargs routing all correct. No security issues. Action items: Split app.test.ts into 3 files, fix empty arrow functions, reduce callback nesting. Story status updated to "In Progress". Next: DEV agent fixes linting violations, re-runs review.
- **2025-10-16**: Story 1.1 (CLI Framework Setup) approved and marked done by DEV agent. All linting violations fixed (150 tests passing, 0 ESLint errors). Moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Story 1.2 (Configuration System) moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Story 1.3 (Interactive Wizard) moved from BACKLOG → TODO.
